<h1> In One Ear </h1>

<h2> by Cage the Elephant </h2>

<p><br></p>

<h3> In One Ear </h3>

<p>They say that we ain&#39;t got the style<br>
We ain&#39;t got the class<br>
We ain&#39;t got the tunes that&#39;s<br>
Gonna put us on the map<br>
And I&#39;m a phony in disguise<br>
Tryin&#39; to make the radio<br>
I&#39;m an anti-social anarchist<br>
I sound like so and so</p>

<p>They say I&#39;m just a stupid kid<br>
Another crazy radical<br>
Rock&#39;n&#39;roll is dead<br>
I probably should have stayed in school<br>
Another generation X<br>
Who somehow slipped up through the cracks<br>
Oh they&#39;d love to see me fall<br>
But I&#39;m already on my back  </p>

<h3> Chorus </h3>

<p>So it goes in one ear and right out the other<br>
People talking sh*t but you know I never bother<br>
It goes in one ear and right out the other<br>
People talking sh*t, they can kiss the back of my hand  </p>

<p>Now I know I&#39;m not a saint<br>
I&#39;ve been a sinner all my life<br>
I ain&#39;t tryin&#39; to hide my flaws<br>
I&#39;d rather keep them in the light<br>
They want to criticize, scrutinize<br>
Cast another stone<br>
Burn me at the stake<br>
And sit and watch it from their throne  </p>

<p>They say the devil is my pal
I do a lot of drugs<br>
The crowd will only like me<br>
If they&#39;re really f*ckin&#39; drunk
They think they know my thoughts<br>
But they don&#39;t know the least<br>
If they&#39;d listen to the words<br>
They&#39;d find a message tucked beneath  </p>

<h3> Chorus </h3> 

<p>But it goes in one ear, and right out the other,<br>
People talkin’ sh*t, even though they never bother,<br>
It goes in one ear, and right out the other,<br>
People talkin’ sh*t, they can kiss the back of my hand!  </p>

<p>You hear that?
You hear what&#39;s coming?<br>
Oh, you better run for the hills<br>
&#39;Cause we&#39;re coming to your town<br>
And we&#39;re gonna burn that motherf*cker down  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the moral to the story
We don&#39;t do it for the glory<br>
We don&#39;t do it for the money<br>
We don&#39;t do it for the fame<br>
So all the critics who despise us<br>
Go ahead and criticize us<br>
It&#39;s your tyranny that drives us<br>
Adds the fire to our flames  </p>

<p>And it goes in one ear and right out the other<br>
People talking sh*t so you know we never bother<br>
It goes in one ear and right out the other<br>
I&#39;m only playing music &#39;cause you know I f*cking love it<br>
It goes in one ear and right out the other<br>
People talking sh*t but you know I never bother<br>
It goes in one ear and right out the other<br>
People talking sh*t, they can kiss the back of my hand  </p>
