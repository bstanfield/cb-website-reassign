  <h1>About Me</h1>
<p class="date">As of May 1st, 2014</p>

<p>I'm 16 and live in Berkeley, CA. I'm an only child, I play baseball but love to play any sport recreationally, and I love to try knew things. I love to travel and meet knew people. I'm a Giants and Niners fan. I'm excited to go to college but I'm unsure as to where that will be just yet.</p>

  <h1> Favorite Hobbies </h1>
<p> I like to play really any sport that involves throwing, especially baseball and dodgeball, but I also have fallen in love with ping pong and <a href="spikeball.com">Spikeball</a>, two sports my friends and I can play in the confines of a backyard.I find the Xbox to be a good pasttime, no matter what game, as long as you're having fun playing it with someone. English and Science are my preferred core classes, but I also really enjoy Epistemology, the theory of learning, and Computer Science, the key to understanding what goes on behind our new, shiny digital world. I love travel, particularly because of the new food (I love food) and culture in which you immerse yourself. I enjoy reading, specifically whitty, edgy stuff like <a href="slate.com">Slate</a>, but can't resist getting sucked into a good Sci-Fi novel. </p>
  
  <h1> Favorite Websites </h1>
 
<p>Firstly, if you're interested in catching up on worldly news but don't have an episode of the <a href="dailyshow.com">Daily Show</a> recorded or don't have the energy to suffer through a long, monotonous, bland news outlet, check out <a href="slate.com">Slate</a>. If you do, however, have the energy and are looking for a good story without the edginess, head over to <a href="nytimes.com">NY Times</a> online (nothing compares to the feel of a Newspaper between your hands, but its inefficiency kills). I also really enjoy <a href="memebase.com">Memebase</a>, for those interested in the cutting edge of pop culture references and hilarious colloquialisms. Their app, which was on the store for several years, has recently been taken down, but their website works just as well, even on mobile platforms. Lastly, <a href="Twitch.tv">Twitch.tv</a>is the best way to unwind at the end of the day and watch a streamer play your favorite game. Your viewership supports the caster through advertisements.</p>
  
  <h1> Favorite Channels </h1>
<p> I couldn't decide on just one Youtuber to crown king of video, so I decided to reveal my top 3. In third place is ERB (Epic Rap Battles of History) and their incredible, catchy rap videos. In second is Minute Physics, where short videos (spoiler alert: they're not all a minute long) teach you just how much your Science teacher should've taught you, but didn't. Because your Science teacher wasn't Henry Reich. Simply put, "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough". </p>
